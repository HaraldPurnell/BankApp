# BankApp

## Overview

BankApp is a tool which, once a user has entered a pin number and the last name associated with that pin number, explores some basic features associated with mobile banking such as transferring funds between two accounts and viewing current balance. All account information is stored in a SQL database. Key features include:

    1. A login page that takes a pin number and customer last name as inputs

    2. A dashboard to view current balance, some basic account information 
       and navigation to other features

    3. A transfer interface to facilitate transfer of funds between current account 
       and another account stored in the database, so long as funds are avaliable
